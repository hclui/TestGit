Add SSH key to github:

1. Open git bash 
2. Type cd ~/.ssh. This will take you to the root directory for Git (Likely C:\Users\[YOUR-USER-NAME]\.ssh\ on Windows)
3. Within the .ssh folder, there should be these two files: id_rsa and id_rsa.pub. These are the files that tell your computer how to communicate with GitHub, BitBucket, or any other Git based service. 
Type ls to see a directory listing. If those two files don't show up, proceed to the next step. NOTE: Your SSH keys must be named id_rsa and id_rsa.pub in order for Git, GitHub, and BitBucket to recognize them by default.
4. To create the SSH keys, type ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com". This will create both id_rsa and id_rsa.pub files.
	NOTE: I use hcluieip@gmail.com but any other email address (or text) would do
	hit return when asked to enter file to save key; passphrase ... etc 
5. do a cat id_rsa.pub & copy the text for the public key to, say Note++ or other editor buffer.
	can go to c:\Users\[your name]\.ssh\ too 
6. Copy the contents--exactly as it appears, with no extra spaces or lines--of id_rsa.pub and 
7. go to https://github.com click the 'blue' button at top right corner; go to settings, SSH & GPG keys; clikc New SSH key; paste the text there, add title (say a PC id), enter password; then click Add SSH key
